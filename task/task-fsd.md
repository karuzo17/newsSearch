# Python Programming Test

## Your Task: A News Search Engine
Your task is to write a simple Flask-based web application, that allows to search in news articles. You can use any 3rd API to retrieve news content and donâ€™t have to implement your own indexing or database system. The frontend should be written in vue.js and contain a search bar which allows to enter any string, and the result after submitting the query should be a list of titles and URLs of the top matching news articles from (at least) the last month. The overall project should contain a simple README and a requirements file.

## Hints
* If you use a secret key to access a third party API, don't submit your secret key, but add an explanation how to get a new one.

## Bonus points for:
* Using Webpack to bundle frontend code
* Ability to choose language before search (e.g. German and English), to limit results to a particular language.
* Displaying thumbnail images with each result
